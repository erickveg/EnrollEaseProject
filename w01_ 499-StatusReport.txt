Overall Status: Behind

Number of hours worked since last update: 5
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 5
Total number of hours anticipated for completion: 126

Accomplishments:
- Defined the main features of my web application
- Researched a Techn Stack suitable for the scope of the project able to use Python for the back-end. I learned that Django can help me develop a full-stack web app with the help of Bootstrap for the front-end.
- Researched different platforms for web app deployment and how to use containers.
- Modeled the data structure to store University courses
- Started a mockup in Figma for the front-end of the application

Challenges:
- Lack of understanding on how to deploy the app once is ready and how databases are stored and connected to the app.
- First time developing a full-stack application. Online blogs, YouTube, and documentation papers have helped me understand the overall technologies used in web app development.

Plans / Goals for next week:
- Set up your Django project and create the initial database models.
- Plan the structure of the application and define its parts.
- Prepare a list of requirements (must and should haves)

Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)
I have set apart 2 hours of my day to work on this project to keep my commitment of 9 working hours every week.

Question: I don't quite understand the copyright policies of our senior project. Can we keep developing our project after graduation and even sell it to different customers?
