Number of hours worked since last update: 8
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 74
Total number of hours anticipated for completion: 15

Accomplishments:
- Stored course codes for faster performance.
- Figured out how to pass my schedule object to the interface.
- Added "gap_time" to each schedule.
- Logic successfully showing schedules where the student doesn't have to walk to much.
- Added information panel with details about each class on a schedule.

Challenges:
- Algorithm is a little bit expensive in terms of time, need to figure out to reduce the number of data or of operations.

Plans / Goals for next week:
- Show all the course code in the search bar
- Only webscrape 'required' classes, not all the classes in the registration system
- Weight schedules by distance

Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)
- I will spend at least 2 hours every morning to work on this project.
