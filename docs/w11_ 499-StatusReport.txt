Team Members:

Overall Status: On schedule

Number of hours worked since last update: 7
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 66
Total number of hours anticipated for completion: 26

Accomplishments:
- Web scrapping classes from University website is working


Challenges:
- Web scrapping all classes take too long now because there are 3919 different sections. I am going to only extract the classes needed by the student instead of the entire catalog, and provide a fixed list of courses to choose from.


Plans / Goals for next week:
- Optimize web scrapping speed
- Weight schedules by distance

Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)
- I will spend at least 2 hours every morning to work on this project.
