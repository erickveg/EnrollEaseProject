Team Members:

Overall Status: On-schedule

Number of hours worked since last update: 8
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 29
Total number of hours anticipated for completion: 100

Accomplishments:
- Got the class combinations algorithm working, 4 classes generated 174 different possible combinations.
- Started looking into presenting the top 5 results into my webpage as a schedule grid.


Challenges:
- There is not too much information online on how to create a schedule with bootstrap, and the syntax is new for me.
- There are lots of folders and files in the project so it's hard to navigate or know where to put my code.


Plans / Goals for next week:
- Return a list of courses to the front-end and present them in a nice table.
- Allow user to input courses from the web site.


Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)
- I will spend at least 1 hour every morning to work on this project.
