Project Title: EnrollEase (Smart Class Registration)

Team Members:

Overall Status: On-schedule

Number of hours worked since last update: 6
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 17
Total number of hours anticipated for completion: 113

Accomplishments:
- Polished original data models adding custom ids
- Generated testing data
- Created a new page to show the optimal schedules
- Draft first algorithm for class selection
- Defined pseudocode and main data structure for the optimization algorithm
- Once a student select his classes, now it will generate a summary list of day, time, and class
- Standarized start and end times of classes for easy computation.


Challenges: 
Keeping clean and reliable data when testing.
There were many options to implement my algorithm, I hope to get a working version of it and optimize it later.
Not sure how to display a nice schedule for the user. I need more Bootstrap knowledge and practice.


Plans / Goals for next week:
- Have an algorithm ready to return at least one optimal schedule based on earliest start time of a class
- Allow user to input classes from the front-end
- Display a schedule on main page similar to the BYUI printable schedule


Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)
I will allocate more time to the project specially on areas that I am not familiar with, 2 hours a day.
